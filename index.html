      <h2>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) continue to revolutionize industries in 2025. From customer support and logistics to healthcare and education, AI technologies are enhancing automation, prediction, and decision-making. These tools analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling smarter business strategies.
        <br><br>
        Applications such as facial recognition, personalized recommendations, and intelligent assistants like ChatGPT are becoming mainstream. With the rapid growth of cloud services, AI adoption is expected to accelerate further.

      <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud computing remains a backbone of modern IT infrastructure in 2025. As remote work, digital platforms, and big data analytics become the norm, businesses increasingly migrate operations to the cloud for greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
        <br><br>
        Platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer serverless computing, AI services, and DevOps tools. Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies help avoid vendor lock-in while supporting continuous innovation, global accessibility, and disaster recovery.

    <section class="trend-box cybersecurity">
      <h2>Cybersecurity Advances</h2>
      <p>
        With growing digital threats, cybersecurity is more crucial than ever. In 2025, organizations are heavily investing in endpoint protection, AI-driven threat analysis, and zero-trust security frameworks where no device or user is inherently trusted.
        <br><br>
        Multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, and blockchain are being widely adopted to safeguard systems. Cybersecurity professionals are in high demand as companies shift toward proactive prevention of cyberattacks like phishing, ransomware, and data breaches.

    <section class="trend-box edge">
      <h2>Edge Computing</h2>
      <p>
        Edge computing processes data closer to its source instead of relying solely on centralized cloud servers. In 2025, this model powers real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries, and smart city technologies.
        <br><br>
        By reducing latency and minimizing bandwidth usage, edge computing enhances performance and responsiveness. It is especially critical in scenarios where data must be processed locally for speed or privacy. When combined with cloud computing, edge computing provides an optimal solution for distributed systems.
